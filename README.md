Our Lady of Peñafrancia Shrine is a Roman Catholic church in the Philippines, located in Naga City. It is
under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Caceres. The church was formerly the home of the image of
Our Lady of Peñafrancia, before the Peñafrancia Basilica was constructed. Our Lady of Peñafrancia is one
of East Asia's greatest sites of Christian pilgrimage.
The parish church is also the location of the Plaza Miguel Robles de Covarrubias, where the Traslacion
procession of Our Lady of Peñafrancia begins, opening the Peñafrancia Festival.
